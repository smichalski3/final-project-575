# Final Group 575: Heavenly Bodies
## Team Members:
Sophie Michalski and Claire Harned

# Final Proposal:
## Target User Persona:
Charlotte is an undergraduate student at UW-Madison. She’s majoring in Art History with certificates in Archaeology and Classics. Charlotte loves taking a wide variety of classes at UW-Madison, and through her education, she has developed academic interests at the intersection of classics, art/art history, and museum studies. After taking Anthro405 (Introduction to Museum Studies), Charlotte is more interested than ever in national patriation/repatriation issues, and is now involved with UW-Madison’s NAGPRA policy efforts. Charlotte is now looking to apply her interests internationally, although she knows there is no NAGPRA-equivalent organization in Europe, so she hopes to uncover other sorts of information. 

Because of her strong interests in art/art history as well, Charlotte wants to know the locations of specific artifacts found in Europe. For a current course, they’re learning about the archaeology of Ancient Greece, and for a project, she’s asked to explore sources, stories, and opinions relating to these artifacts. She also wants to retrieve other information about these artifacts, such as the dates they were made, their artists, if they are recreations/originals, and the material of which they are made. To track certain patterns or trends in this data, Charlotte would like to filter some of the artifacts based on their characteristics. Additionally, Charlotte would like to visualize the movement of artifacts as it relates to repatriation. She knows that the British Museum is notorious for their unethical museum practices, but is curious to compare other museum patterns too. Once obtained, Charlotte can use this new information to supplement her current coursework, inform decisions about potential topics for her undergraduate/graduate research, and encourage her to advocate for more ethical forms of museum curation. 

## User-Case Scenario:
Upon arriving at the interactive, Charlotte is greeted by the title of the story (Heavenly Bodies). She likes the design choices of the site, like the colors and styles, so her interest is immediately piqued. Charlotte scrolls through some of the initial text describing a brief overview relating to ancient Greek statues and museum repatriation issues before she views the first map. This map shows the locations of where the statues were originally found/created. She retrieves information about these sites to discover more specific information about each artifact (potential to filter these statues based on different characteristics, but could also use some different colors for the most important characteristic). Charlotte scrolls through more story information explaining the map. Next, Charlotte finds another map that represents the current locations of each statue (most likely in a museum). Charlotte pans and zooms around the map to see the widespread variety of museums that now house these artifacts, and which museums house the most (proportional symbol map?). Charlotte reads more text. Finally, she views a last map, that compares and patternizes the location of each artifact since its discovery to its current location (either a slider bar map to show before/after or perhaps lines that show the movement of artifacts). 

# Requirements Document

## Representation
1: Basemaps/slippy maps: Style designed through Mapbox or CARTO; projections from ArcGIS Pro or QIS; initial map information/vectors from Natural Earth

2: Statue information: Spatial dataset of statue coordinates/artist information if it is known

3: Museums: Spatial dataset of museum coordinates 

4: Story information/overview: The text on the story page that explains the problem of repatriation, purpose of maps, filler photos etc. 

5: Movement lines/routes: Lines representing the movement of the statues throughout the phases

6: Legend: Legend on each map representing distances/meanings of colors/points/etc.

## Interaction 
1: Scrolling: User is able to scroll through the webpage to view each map, the story text, and other information incuded on the page.

2: Slippy maps: Pan and zoom; the user is able to toggle their view of the map using their cursor/finger/scroll

3: Pan/zoom toggle: Pan and zoom; the user is able to manually toggle the zoom and pan from a widget in the corner of the map

4: Statue click/hover: Retrieve; obtaining information about each statue, such as artist, location, dates, etc.

5: Museum click/hover: Retrieve; obtaining information about each museum and when/how the statue got there

6: Query Panel: Filter or sequence; using the panel, the user is able to adjust which sequence they would like to look at: where the statues were originally from, where they were found, & where they ended up.

7: Object hover: Resymbolize; the user is able to hover over whichever phase they are on with each statue and learn more information about how it got there/when/where the statue is in that phase
