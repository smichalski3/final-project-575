                    Greek statues are renowned for their remarkable attention to detail, intricate designs,

                    played a significant role in ancient Greek culture and religion.

                    in their statesque sculpture-making. More importantly, the Greeks believed that 
                    men and women were made in the likeness of the gods.

                    the slipping drapery, suggests at the same time an energetic movement to 
                    secure balance. It energizes the whole attitude and enhances the grace of 
                    the daintier body. The twisting figure and modernized drapery give the 
                    Venus great nobility.
